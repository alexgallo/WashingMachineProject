REPLIES FROM THE CONTACTS

- KOCH SYSTEMS:- 
Phone conversation with Jack Noble dated 25/07/16
Details of conversation:- is able to look into a laundry water system - has two options for us: pressurised + submerged
pressurised is a cartilage or a module that is typically used but system is energy intensive
Jack was aware we would be getting energy from solar panels and has suggested submerged systems instead 
He will be sending me details of the two membranes and additional data on laundry water

-ESMIL:- 
Director of Technology is looking into VSEP technologies that particularly deal with laundry water
Is going to give us a quote soon 
I will be in touch with him tuesday/wednesday to see what he has come up with 

-LENNTECH 
- no reply so far 

- KALSEP 
- they do not provide membranes for cleaning use - they only provide membranes for already clean water
- as means of additional filteration 

- EVOQUA 
- No reply so far - I have sent an email
