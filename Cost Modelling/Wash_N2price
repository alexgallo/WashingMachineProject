%Q is defined as cycles per week

%NOTE: Integration of mass of laundry/day considerations requries
%combination of this cost analysis with a corresponding demand curve. The
%definintion of the value of the rate of laundry production of Batima
%residents would affect both the demand and supply curve.

%Hence: Start with Quantity of cycles demanded
Q_Day=Q/7; %Total number of cycles demanded in a day.

%Consideration of days allows for 'worst case scenarios'- such as peak
%demand during weekends

N_req=Q_Day/Open_hr*T_cycle; %Do we want to set 'Open_hr' or 24hrs?
