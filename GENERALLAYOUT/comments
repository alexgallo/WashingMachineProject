Layout change from discussion 24/07/16 during SKYPE meeting

- Rain water filter will filter debris but not fine particles - collected water will go through mesh series
- settlement tank will feed into buffer tank (containing rain water and sandfree recycled water) 
- All water will go through a membrane system 
- All water will be disinfected

With regards to Charles question during skype meeting about inlet pump requirement:- the answer is yes. We do need a pump 
water pressure is 1bar gauge, not absolute, meaing 1bar greater than atm pressure - a pump is required

new draft updated after speaking to guttermate technical developers 
Very keen to use their products on this 
The changes made affect the layout of the rain water catchment system 
This is most likely the final scenario 
Please look at raincatchment system to read about the chosen products

In terms of the pump before the tri-filter system - I doubt we will need one 
I think gravity filter might work better here
I have contacted Hayden Robinson, the tech developer for guttermate to clarify this
