Layout change from discussion 24/07/16 during SKYPE meeting

- Rain water filter will filter debris but not fine particles - collected water will go through mesh series
- settlement tank will feed into buffer tank (containing rain water and sandfree recycled water) 
- All water will go through a membrane system 
- All water will be disinfected

With regards to Charles question during skype meeting about inlet pump requirement:- the answer is yes. We do need a pump 
water pressure is 1bar gauge, not absolute, meaing 1bar greater than atm pressure - a pump is required
