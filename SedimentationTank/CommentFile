AIM: TO CALCULATE SETTLING TIME OF PARTICLES IN THE SEDIMENTATION TANK 

TO READERS:- these calculations will give an estimate of the settling velocity for the suspended particles in the tank 
This is important because it will allow us to understand when we can start our pumps for the filteration processes




NOTE TO SELF:- 
1) Is this class 1 sedimentation; work out whether the particles in the grey water will settle or float? 
2) Find out avg densities of particles - clay + sand + remaining laundry detergent 
3) Apply equations to solve equation to find settling time
