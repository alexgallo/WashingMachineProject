Details on the method of collection 
DATE:- 25/07/16

Ideal supplier for filter and diverter system:-

Will filter most of the debris in the water up to 800 micrometers
- Rain in Rwanda is cyclical - very heavy cycles of rain followed by dry spell 
- The large pipe can collect all that water and go to the buffer tank (See system layout for more details) 

PROCEDURE FOR CLEANING AFTER THIS:- 
Rain water will still contain suspended particles and collodial particles
Will require additional filteration 


CURRENT SOLUTION - 25/07/16
Send the water through the membrane system for filteration and finally into storage

NEW SOLUTION - 26/07/16
UPDATE TO THE SYSTEM LAYOUT 
Direct filtered rain water though a filteration system different to the filteration system used for laundry water:-

A PUMP IS REQUIRED FOR THIS:- 
According to our GutterMate tech. contact, Haydon:- 
"The flow through the filters can be regulated by using a control valve in the pipework either before or after the filters.
You could use gravity, however you would need a pump to get the water into a header tank 
which would need to be above the filters. to enable you to use gravity to get the water through the filters.
The other issue with this would be the pressure drop through the filters would be quite large and 
I think you would only get a very low flow through the filter. As you use the filters the dirt caught by the filter 
would also reduce the flow making it very difficult to predict the flow you would get through the filter just using gravity."
