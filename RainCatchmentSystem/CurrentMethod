Ideal supplier for filter and diverter system:- 
https://www.guttermate.co.uk/diverters-filters/gutter-mate-diverter-filter.html

Will filter most of the debris in the water up to 800 micrometers
- Rain in Rwanda is cyclical - very heavy cycles of rain followed by dry spell 
- The large pipe can collect all that water and go to the buffer tank (See system layout for more details) 

PROCEDURE FOR CLEANING AFTER THIS:- 
Rain water will still contain suspended particles and collodial particles
Will require additional filteration 

CURRENT SOLUTION 
Send the water through the membrane system for filteration and finally into storage
